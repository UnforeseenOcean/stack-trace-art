##Communicate Yourself
*StackTraceangelo* will help you to express and communicate yourself to other programmers in a very unique way - by drawing a piece of art on exception stack trace.

Just by using [the *StackTraceangelo* Art Gallery](/Source/ArtGallery/ArtGallery.md) you can easily:

* tell to your colleagues to [be careful the cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPAJomPCdZs)

##Rekindle Your Artistic Soul
The best way to start rekindling your artistic soul and learn how to efficiently use *stackTraceangelo* is to visit [its official YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/stackTraceangelo). Although being in early proof-of-concept stage, *stackTraceangelo* is mature enough to help you draw your own piece of Stack Trace Art. So, **download it, create some cool pieces of Stack Trace Art and inject them into other programmer's code**.

After you do so, please don't forget to share your art with me. I'll be happy to see it.
