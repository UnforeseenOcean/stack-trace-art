StackTraceangelo is a [Stack Trace Art](http://www.thehumbleprogrammer.com/stack-trace-art) editor.

##What can I do with it?
You can use it to express and communicate yourself to other programmers by drawing a piece of art on an exception stack trace.

For example, you can:

* tell to your colleagues to [be careful the cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPAJomPCdZs)

* make them believe that Space Invaders actually did attack their program
